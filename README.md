The motivation to develop this program mainly by two points, the first is the development of embedded in the need for a serial debugging software, followed by the computer does not allow the installation of software restrictions. But I found that the use of Javascript real-time data acquisition is difficult. But in this program can reach about 5ms refresh time. This procedure is recommended for research purposes. For real-time applications, I do not recommend using this software instead of professional software. If anyone is interested in the technical details of this program, I am happy to be able to help.
